## Generation Instructions

When generating the dataset, follow this systematic approach:

### Phase 1: Studio Planning
Create 8-12 fictional game studios with distinct personalities:
- 2-3 premium studios (high production value)
- 2-3 high-volume studios (many releases)
- 2-3 specialty studios (unique mechanics or themes)
- 1-2 sports-focused studios
- 1-2 classic/retro studios

### Phase 2: Theme Allocation
Distribute 100 games across themes:
1. Start with mandatory minimums
2. Add sports-influenced games (beyond pure sports themes)
3. Include seasonal/event games throughout
4. Ensure no theme exceeds 20% of total

### Phase 3: Mathematical Balance
For each game, ensure:
- RTP correlates with game type (branded/premium = higher)
- Volatility matches theme expectations
- Hit frequency inversely relates to volatility
- Max win aligns with volatility (low: 500-2000x, high: 5000-50000x)

### Phase 4: Feature Assignment
Layer mechanics thoughtfully:
- Base games: 2-3 standard mechanics
- Premium games: Add 1-2 special features
- Avoid feature overload (max 5 total)
- Match features to theme where logical

### Phase 5: Metadata Enhancement
Complete remaining fields:
- Descriptions that sell the experience
- Realistic pace assignments
- Appropriate visual density
- Mobile optimization (default true unless retro)
- Release years following distribution

### Phase 6: Final Validation
Before output:
- Check all required fields populated
- Verify no duplicate titles
- Confirm mathematical logic
- Validate theme distribution
- Ensure studio consistency

## Example Output Patterns

To ensure quality, each game should follow patterns like:

```json
{
  "id": "game-001",
  "title": "Gladiator's Fortune",
  "studio": "Epic Reels Studios",
  "theme": ["Ancient Rome", "Warrior", "Historical"],
  "volatility": "high",
  "rtp": 96.2,
  "maxWin": 10000,
  "reelLayout": "5x3",
  "paylines": 20,
  "mechanics": ["Expanding Wilds", "Free Spins", "Multipliers"],
  "features": ["Bonus Buy", "Progressive Multipliers"],
  "pace": "medium",
  "hitFrequency": 0.22,
  "bonusFrequency": 0.006,
  "artStyle": "3D realistic",
  "audioVibe": "Epic orchestral",
  "visualDensity": "standard",
  "mobileOptimized": true,
  "releaseYear": 2024,
  "description": "Battle for glory in ancient Rome with expanding wild gladiators and escalating multipliers during epic free spin battles"
}
```

## CRITICAL REMINDERS

1. **No Real IP**: All games must be fictional. No actual slot games, real casinos, or branded content.
2. **Schema Strict**: Never add fields. Never skip required fields. Never modify field types.
3. **Logical Consistency**: All mathematical parameters must make sense together.
4. **Diversity Mandate**: Avoid clustering. Spread themes, studios, and features evenly.
5. **JSON Only**: Output pure JSON array. No markdown, no comments, no explanations.
