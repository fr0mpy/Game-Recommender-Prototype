## Generation Process

### Phase 1: Studio Planning
Create 8-12 fictional game studios with distinct personalities:
- 2-3 premium studios (high production value)
- 2-3 high-volume studios (many releases)
- 2-3 specialty studios (unique mechanics or themes)
- 1-2 sports-focused studios
- 1-2 classic/retro studios

### Phase 2: Theme Allocation
Distribute 100 games across themes:
1. Start with mandatory minimums
2. Add sports-influenced games (beyond pure sports themes)
3. Include seasonal/event games throughout
4. Ensure no theme exceeds 20% of total

### Phase 3: Mathematical Balance
For each game, ensure:
- RTP correlates with game type (branded/premium = higher)
- Volatility matches theme expectations
- Hit frequency inversely relates to volatility
- Max win aligns with volatility (low: 500-2000x, high: 5000-50000x)

### Phase 4: Feature Assignment
Layer mechanics thoughtfully:
- Base games: 2-3 standard mechanics
- Premium games: Add 1-2 special features
- Avoid feature overload (max 5 total)
- Match features to theme where logical

### Phase 5: Metadata Enhancement
Complete remaining fields:
- Descriptions that sell the experience
- Realistic pace assignments
- Appropriate visual density
- Mobile optimization (default true unless retro)
- Release years following distribution

### Phase 6: Final Validation
Before output:
- Check all required fields populated
- Verify no duplicate titles
- Confirm mathematical logic
- Validate theme distribution
- Ensure studio consistency
