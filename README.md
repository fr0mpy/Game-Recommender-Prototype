{
  game: gameObject,           // Complete game data
  score: 0.73,               // Similarity score (0-1 range)  
  confidence: 73,            // Confidence percentage (0-100)
  analysis: analysisObject   // Detailed analysis (LLM) or null (Algorithmic)
}
```

**LLM Engine Analysis Object**:
```javascript
analysis: {
  similarity_score: 73,
  confidence_level: "high",
  primary_factors: "Mythological themes + medium volatility + complex bonus systems",
  secondary_factors: "Similar art styles + comparable studio quality", 
  contextual_fit: "Both games suit evening leisure sessions with high attention spans",
  context_boost: 5,
  key_differences: "Egyptian focus vs Nordic mythology, different audio aesthetics",

## 🧪 LLM Testing Strategy

### **The LLM Testing Challenge**
Testing AI responses requires different approaches than traditional software testing:

- **Non-Deterministic**: Same input may produce different outputs
- **Creative Content**: LLMs generate novel content, not predictable responses  
- **Quality Assessment**: How do you measure "good" vs "bad" LLM output?

### **Our Testing Approach**

#### **1. Contract-Based Testing** (Most Reliable)
```javascript
test('LLM explanations have required structure', async () => {
  const explanations = await generateLLMExplanations(/*...*/);
  
  expect(explanations).toHaveLength(5);
  explanations.forEach(explanation => {
    expect(explanation.length).toBeGreaterThan(30);
    expect(explanation).toMatch(/[.!]/);
    expect(explanation).not.toContain('undefined');
  });
});
```

#### **2. Keyword and Pattern Validation**  
```javascript
test('LLM mentions dominant weight factors', async () => {
  const weights = { bonusFrequency: 1.0, theme: 0.0 };
  const explanations = await generateLLMExplanations(/*...*/);
  
  explanations.forEach(explanation => {
    expect(explanation.toLowerCase()).toContain('bonus frequency');
    expect(explanation).toMatch(/\d+\.?\d*%/);
  });
});
```

#### **3. Behavioral Consistency Testing**
```javascript
test('different contexts produce different reasoning', async () => {
  const workContext = { sessionType: 'work', attentionSpan: 'short' };
  const leisureContext = { sessionType: 'leisure', attentionSpan: 'long' };
  
  const workExplanations = await generateLLMExplanations(/*...*/, workContext);
  const leisureExplanations = await generateLLMExplanations(/*...*/, leisureContext);
  
  expect(workExplanations[0]).not.toBe(leisureExplanations[0]);
  expect(workExplanations[0].toLowerCase()).toMatch(/work|quick|pause/);
});
```

## 🧪 Key User Flow Testing

### **🎯 Flow 1: Game Discovery Journey**
```javascript
// User selects game → gets recommendations → sees explanations
test('user selects game and receives contextual recommendations', () => {
  // GIVEN: User on homepage with game list  
  // WHEN: User selects specific game
  // THEN: System generates 5 ranked recommendations with explanations
});
```

### **🎚️ Flow 2: Weight Customization Journey**  
```javascript
// User adjusts preferences → sees different recommendations
test('different weight preferences produce different recommendations', () => {
  // Theme-focused vs Volatility-focused recommendations
  // 100% weight handling and extreme scenarios
});
```

### **⚡ Flow 3: Dual-Engine Experience**
```javascript
// User toggles between algorithmic and LLM engines
test('algorithmic engine provides fast mathematical analysis', () => {
  // <250ms processing time validation
  // Mathematical scoring vs semantic analysis
});
```

### **🎮 Flow 4: Game Generation & Persistence**  
```javascript  
// User generates custom games → games persist → recommendations work
test('custom game generation maintains data integrity', () => {
  // Generated games integrate with recommendation system
  // Mixed default and custom games handling
});
```
