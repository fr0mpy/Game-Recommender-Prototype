## üîß Technical Architecture

**Stack**: Node.js + Express + EJS + Tailwind CSS + Anthropic Claude API + Upstash Redis

**Storage**: 
- Redis (Upstash) for persistent custom games in serverless environments
- Session-based context tracking for recommendations

**Similarity Algorithm**:
- Weighted scoring: Theme (40%) + Volatility (30%) + Studio (20%) + Mechanics (10%)
- Produces unique match percentages (e.g., 48%, 36%, 33%, 31%)
- Dynamic weight adjustment affects ranking order

**Context Analysis**:
- Real-time temporal pattern detection (work vs. leisure)
- Financial cycle awareness (payday vs. end-of-month)
- Attention span and focus level assessment
- Device and usage pattern recognition

## üöÄ Deployment

**Production**: Vercel with Upstash Redis

**Requirements**:
- Node.js 18+
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` environment variable
- `KV_REST_API_URL` and `KV_REST_API_TOKEN` for Redis storage
