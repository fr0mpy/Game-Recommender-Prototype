## Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:

**Performance Metrics:**

- Memory usage trends
- Cache hit/miss rates

**Business Metrics:**
- Cost per session tracking

- Error log pattern analysis
- Environment variable access attempts

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:
- LLM API changes or new models available
- Performance degrades beyond thresholds
- New security vulnerabilities discovered
- User load patterns change significantly
- Cost patterns deviate from expectations
- New features added to similarity engine

## Quality Gate Integration

**Deterministic Risk-Based Gate Mapping:**

- **Current Risk Score: 45/100 â†’ FAIL**
  - 3 Critical risks require mitigation
  - High-risk areas need comprehensive testing
  - Cannot proceed to production without addressing critical risks

**Gate Progression Requirements:**
- **CONCERNS Gate**: Risk score >65, all critical risks mitigated
- **PASS Gate**: Risk score >80, only low risks remaining
- **Production Ready**: Risk score >90, comprehensive monitoring

**Recommended Actions:**
1. Implement critical risk mitigations immediately
2. Establish comprehensive test suite for high-risk areas
3. Create monitoring and alerting for ongoing risk management
4. Conduct thorough testing before quality gate reassessment
