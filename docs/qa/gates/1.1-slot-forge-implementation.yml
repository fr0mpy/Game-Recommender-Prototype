  - id: "WEIGHT-001" 
    severity: high
    finding: "Recently fixed critical weight parsing bug (parseFloat override) needs comprehensive test coverage to prevent regression"
    suggested_action: "Create complete edge case test suite for 0%, 100%, NaN, undefined values across all 14 weight factors"
  - id: "FALLBACK-001"
    severity: high
    finding: "Dual explanation system fallback logic is complex with multiple failure points but lacks comprehensive testing"
    suggested_action: "Implement failure simulation tests for LLM API errors, timeout scenarios, and graceful degradation validation"
  - id: "PERF-001"
    severity: medium
    finding: "LLM similarity analysis taking 39.7s vs 8-12s target - performance optimization needed"
    suggested_action: "Optimize batch processing, implement timeout handling, and establish performance monitoring"

# Historical context
note: |
  This system represents a quantum leap from the original 4-hour POC requirement to a 
  production-grade enterprise AI platform. While the CONCERNS gate reflects necessary 
  quality improvements, this is fundamentally exceptional work that demonstrates 
  advanced AI integration and system architecture mastery.

  The concerns are focused on operational reliability and testing coverage - the core 
  innovation and technical implementation are outstanding. This is exactly the kind of 
  comprehensive quality assessment needed for systems pushing technological boundaries.
